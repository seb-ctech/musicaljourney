Euterpea is a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for computer music research, education, and development, providing both note-level and signal-level abstractions. It is a descendant of Haskore and HasSound, and is intended for both educational purposes as well as serious computer music applications. 

Some code: 

```haskell 
showList :: [NoteAttribute] -> ShowS 
```
